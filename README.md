# Solana Agentic Wallet

**Superteam Nigeria DeFi Developer Challenge Submission**

Three autonomous AI agents running on Solana devnet — each managing its own wallet, making price-aware trading decisions, executing real on-chain transactions, and autonomously interacting with a custom deployed Anchor program.

---

## What This Is

A multi-agent system where each AI agent has its own Solana keypair, reasons about market conditions using live SOL price data, and autonomously executes transactions through a 3-gate security system. No human input required after startup.

Each agent:
- Checks the live SOL/USD price via CoinGecko
- Assesses market trend (bullish vs bearish)
- Decides whether to deploy liquidity (SPL token creation + transfer) or conserve it (SOL transfer)
- Deposits and withdraws SOL from its own on-chain vault via a custom Anchor program
- Signs and broadcasts all transactions independently
- Has its own spending cap and daily transaction limit enforced before every action

---

## Demo

Start the system with `npm start`. Three agents initialize in parallel, each with its own Solana keypair and spending limits. Every 90 seconds a new cycle runs:

- **Hedge** reads the SOL price, assesses risk, and executes a small conservative SOL transfer to a sibling agent
- **Strategist** reads the market signal and either deploys liquidity (bullish) or conserves capital (bearish)
- **Raider** creates an SPL token mint, mints 1000 tokens, distributes 100 to a sibling, and deposits SOL into its AgentVault

All three run in parallel. Every transaction is signed autonomously, passes through the 3-gate GuardedSigner, and is broadcast to Solana devnet. All signatures are logged to the terminal with Solana Explorer links.

Live dashboard available at `dashboard.html` — shows real-time balances, decisions per cycle, and activity feed.

```

**Agent Layer** — Claude Haiku via LangGraph ReAct. Each agent has 8 tools: `check_balance`, `get_sol_price`, `transfer_sol`, `deploy_token`, `get_stats`, `vault_deposit`, `vault_withdraw`, `vault_status`. Agents reason step-by-step before every action and maintain memory across cycles via `MemorySaver`.

**Wallet Layer** — `AgenticWallet` wraps a `KeypairWallet` from Solana Agent Kit. `KeyManager` handles keypair generation and persistence. `AgentVaultClient` manages all interactions with the AgentVault Anchor program. `GuardedSigner` enforces the 3-gate security model before any transaction broadcasts.

**Security Layer** — Every transaction passes 3 gates in sequence:
1. Spending cap check (per-agent hard limit)
2. Daily transaction limit (per-agent session cap)
3. On-chain simulation via `simulateTransaction` — dry-run before broadcast

**On-Chain Programs:**
- `AgentVault` (`JCDFEsY5Jq22vJRsUiKY6X4xxKmmavwtdiD4unaQridp`) — custom Anchor program, PDA vaults per agent
- `SPL Token Program` — token mint creation, minting, transfers
- `System Program` — SOL transfers

**Kora Layer** — `kora.toml` defines the paymaster policy: program allowlists (including AgentVault), token allowlists, fee caps, and rate limits. This is a policy definition, not a running node — it documents the production security posture for fee sponsorship.

## AgentVault — Custom Anchor Program

Deployed on devnet at `JCDFEsY5Jq22vJRsUiKY6X4xxKmmavwtdiD4unaQridp`.

Each agent has a PDA vault derived from its wallet address. The vault tracks:
- Lifetime deposits and withdrawals in lamports
- Deposit and withdrawal transaction counts
- Net SOL position at any point

Agents autonomously call `initialize_vault`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` as part of their decision cycles. Every vault transaction is verifiable on Solana Explorer. Vault state persists permanently on-chain.

See `programs/agentvault/src/lib.rs` for the full program source and `target/idl/agentvault.json` for the IDL.

## Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- An Anthropic API key (Claude Haiku)
- A Helius API key (free tier — for devnet RPC)

---

## Setup

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solana-agentic-wallet
cd solana-agentic-wallet
npm install
```

**2. Configure environment**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
SOLANA_RPC=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=your-helius-key
MAX_AGENTS=3
SPENDING_CAP_SOL=0.05
```

Get a free Helius API key at [dashboard.helius.dev](https://dashboard.helius.dev).

**3. Fund the agent wallets**

Run once to generate keypairs:

```bash
npm start
```

Copy the 3 public keys printed on startup and fund each with 2 SOL at [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com).

**4. Run**

```bash
# Main autonomous demo
npm start

# Web dashboard — open dashboard.html in browser after npm start
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start 3 autonomous agents in parallel |
| `npm run demo` | CLI observer showing live agent stats |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript |

## What Agents Do

Each cycle (every 90 seconds):

1. Read sibling activity feed — coordinate to avoid duplicate actions
2. Fetch live SOL/USD price from CoinGecko
3. Check balance
4. Decide based on market conditions:
   - **Stop-loss active** (balance < threshold) → report status only
   - **Bullish + sufficient balance** → `deploy_token` + `vault_deposit`
   - **Bearish + sufficient balance** → `transfer_sol` + `vault_status`
   - **Coordination active** → pivot to complementary action if sibling just acted
5. All transactions pass through GuardedSigner before broadcast

---

## Security Model

```typescript
// Gate 1 — Spending cap
if (amountLamports > this.spendingCapLamports) → BLOCKED

// Gate 2 — Daily limit  
if (this.transactionCount >= this.maxDailyTransactions) → BLOCKED

// Gate 3 — On-chain simulation
const sim = await connection.simulateTransaction(tx)
if (sim.err) → BLOCKED
```

All three gates must pass. The transaction is never signed or broadcast if any gate fails.

Vault transactions additionally pass through AgentVault's own on-chain constraints: owner validation, rent-exempt enforcement, overflow-checked arithmetic. Two independent security systems in sequence.

**Persistent counters:** Transaction counts and total spent survive restarts — written to disk after every authorized transaction and restored on startup.
